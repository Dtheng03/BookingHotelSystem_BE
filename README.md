Project Rules:

Commit Title:
Each commit should have a clear title describing the change it introduces.
Titles should be written in English and follow Title Case.
Avoid using slang, unprofessional language, or questions in the title.


Commit Content:
Each commit should come with detailed content, providing a clear explanation of the changes made.
Avoid large commits and break down changes into smaller, more specific commits, each addressing a distinct task.
Refrain from committing unrelated files in a single commit.


Code Review:
All new changes should undergo code review before merging into the main branch.
At least one other team member must review and approve the code before merging.
Address and resolve feedback received during the code review.


Accept Changes from Other Branches:
Avoid committing directly to the main/master branch.
Use feature branches to develop new features and make changes.
